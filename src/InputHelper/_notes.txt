InputCombiner
    map multiple keys to single key, eg. press [U][L] --> [1]

InputDebouncer
    apply time persistence check on input for stability

InputFilterInterface
InputFilterList
    list of input filters, eg. apply slot then mapping

InputGroupedBase
InputGroupedDB
InputGroupedRP
InputGroupedMC
InputGrouped
    group multiple source of inputs
    eg. 3 digital buttons, instead of separately checking each for HIGH/LOW
        group them together to check single object
        grp.getKey() --> '1', '2' or '3'

InputKeyFilterCore
InputKeyFilter
    filter allowed, disallowed keys

InputKeyMapper
    map input index to keys, eg. 1 --> 'A', 2 --> 'B'

InputLinearScale
    scale input linearly, eg. 0..1024 --> 0..100

InputMultiClick
InputMultiClickMapper
    handle multiple clicks, eg. press 1, 3 times

InputRepeater
    repeat keys if continuously held down

InputRunningAvg
InputRunningAvgChained
    perform averaging for adc readings

InputSlotter
    map input range to another value, eg. 0..100 --> 'A', 101..200 --> 'B'

Verbose Function/Variable Names

    to prevent collision during multiple inheritance

Multiple Inheritance

    possible to use each functionality by composition instead of inheritance
    eg. create InputDebouncer, InputCombiner, ...
        as objects inside another class
        but will need extra pointer for each

    using multiple inheritance, less pointers

Settings
    eg. debounce time, repeat delay, ...

    Options:
    A. global settings
       by default each instance points to global settings
       modify global settings to apply to all
       create new settings to apply to specific instances

       PRO:  saves memory, easy to apply to several instances
       CONS: involves pointer and confusing
             must prevent creation on stack
             if template, must create global outside the class, for single instance
    B. separate copy per instance
       CONS: have to apply to each if default is not acceptable
             waste of memory

    Since it's part of the UI, there won't be too many instances.
    Also for numerous buttons, it would be better to group it,
        hence only a single settings will be created for the whole group.

    OLD CODE:

        struct InputDebouncerSettings {
            // prevent creation on stack and be referenced
            private: InputDebouncerSettings() {}
            public: static InputDebouncerSettings *create() { return new InputDebouncerSettings; }

            uint16_t debounceDelayPressedInMs = 0;      // time delay before checking for stabilized signal
            uint16_t debounceDelayReleasedInMs = 0;
            uint16_t stabilizedTimePressedInMs = 50;    // debouncing keyDown time
            uint16_t stabilizedTimeReleasedInMs = 10;   // debouncing keyUp time
            // uint16_t minimumDebounceTimeInMs = 50;   // minimum debounce time before allowed to be cancelled 
        };

        static struct InputDebouncerSettings *globalInputDebouncerSettings = InputDebouncerSettings::create();

        template<typename T>
        class InputDebouncer {

            // DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE IF FORCE TO HEAP
            // create reference so user can go: obj.globalDebouncerSettings->stabilizedTimePressedInMs = 50;
            // static constexpr InputDebouncerSettings *globalDebouncerSettings = &StarterPack::globalInputDebouncerSettings;

            // actual settings per instance, by default points to global
            InputDebouncerSettings *debouncerSettings = StarterPack::globalInputDebouncerSettings;

            void changeDebouncerSettings(...) { ... }
            InputDebouncerSettings *createDebouncerSettings(...) {
                // create and use a new settings, caller should handle freeing memory
                auto s = new InputDebouncerSettings();
                ...
                this->debouncerSettings = s;
                return s;
            }
            void assignDebouncerSettings( InputDebouncerSettings *settings ) {
                // caller is still owner and should handle freeing memory
                this->debouncerSettings = settings;
            }
        }
        // template <typename T>
        // struct InputDebouncer<T>::Settings InputDebouncer<T>::globalDebouncerSettings;
